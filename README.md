This provides a script which will download the Linux Android SDK and builds Allegro for you.

This is work in progress, at the very least need to:
- support updating, right now always have to start over
- support publishing the resulting .aar file to jcenter or similar
- document how to use the .aar file in your Allegro game (especially NDK cmake setup)
